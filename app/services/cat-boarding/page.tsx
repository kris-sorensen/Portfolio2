        Welcome to Happy Tails Cat Boarding, where we understand that cats need
        a special kind of care and attention. Our cat boarding facility is
        designed to cater to the unique needs of your feline friends, ensuring
        they feel comfortable, secure, and entertained throughout their stay.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Our accommodations are spacious and calm, with private sleeping areas
        that allow your cat to relax in a stress-free environment. Each cat
        condo is equipped with soft bedding, climbing structures, and plenty of
        space to roam and explore.
      </p>
      <br />

        We prioritize the health and safety of all our guests. The cat boarding
        area is separate from the dog areas to ensure a peaceful atmosphere. All
        enclosures are cleaned and sanitized daily, and fresh water and meals
        are provided according to your pet&apos;s regular schedule.
